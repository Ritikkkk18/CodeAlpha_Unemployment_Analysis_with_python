# CodeAlpha-Unemployment_Analysis_with_python
A data science project analyzing unemployment trends in India with interactive visualizations, regional comparisons, and COVID-19 impact analysis using Python, Pandas, and Streamlit.
# 📊 Unemployment Analysis in India

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **unemployment trends in India** using real-world data to understand **regional disparities**, **urban vs rural differences**, and **time-based patterns**, including the **impact of COVID-19**.  
An interactive **Streamlit dashboard** is developed to visualize key insights dynamically.

This project was completed as part of the **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship**.
